# NetSim-experiment
Experiment encapsulating various aspects of network behaviour, providing a modular and comprehensive exploration of network dynamics using C++ programming. WIP


## Key Features

### Packet Transmission Simulation:
Utilizes a Poisson process to model packet transmissions in a network, representing events occurring independently at a constant average rate.

### Bandwidth Utilization:
Simulates the utilization of network bandwidth over time, crucial for understanding network capacity and performance.

### Network Error Rate:
Models error rates in networking based on signal-to-noise ratios, aiding in understanding the reliability of network communication.

### Load Balancing:
Implements simulations to manage traffic across multiple network paths, ensuring efficient data distribution.

### Network Congestion:
Examines the effects of varying data rates and packet sizes on network congestion levels.

### Exponential Network Delay:
Uses exponential distribution to simulate network delays, modeling the time between events in continuous, independent processes.

### Network Failures:
Randomly simulates network failures in a distributed system, assessing the robustness and reliability of the network.

### Routing Efficiency:
Calculates the efficiency of different routing paths, essential for optimizing network routing strategies.

### Topology Change Impact:
Evaluates the effects of changes in network topology on data flow and latency.

### Packet Prioritization (WIP):
Demonstrates the prioritization of various types of data packets, critical in managing network traffic effectively.

## Technology
C++ Standard Template Library for data handling, Poisson distribution and the Exponential distribution for data modelling.
